The long chain hydrocarbon part in soap/detergent is repelled by water molecules and is called                        hydrophobic. However, it is attracted by oil or grease molecules.                    65. Sodium ions, forming the short ionic part in soap/detergent are attracted by water molecules and                        is called hydrophilic. However, it is repelled by oil or grease molecules.                                       AL BROTHERS PRAKASHAN                    66. The colloidal particles of soap suspended in water form clusters, which are commonly called                        soap micelles.                    67. Soap loses its cleaning action in hard water and forms a sticky scum.                    68. Synthetic detergents lather even in hard water and hence can be used for cleaning.                                            I.

[2011  (T-II)]                  Ans. When ethanol is oxidised, hydrogen is removed from its molecule and oxygen is added so as                        to form ethanoic acid. Thus, conversion of ethanol into acetic acid is an oxidation reaction.                    2. A mixture of ethyne and oxygen is burnt for welding. Can you tell why a mixture of ethyne and                        air is not used?                                                                             (Imp.)                                                                7","Ans. Ethyne has only two hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms in its molecule. It burns in air with                        a sooty flame, because the oxygen from air is insufficient to burn the carbon completely. Thus,                        pure oxygen is used which completely burns carbon and hydrogen and produces a very hot                        flame.                   Page 74                      1. How will you distinguish between alcohol and carboxylic acid experimentally?       (V. Imp.)                   Ans. Take two test tubes A and B and place about 1 g of sodium carbonate in them. Pour alcohol                        in test tube A and carboxylic acid in test tube B. Shake the contents of the test tubes.

The test tube in which no reaction takes place is alcohol.                            2                     2. What are oxidising agents ?                   Ans. The substances which add oxygen atom/atoms to the molecule/atom of a given substance or                        remove hydrogen atom/atoms from it, are called oxidising agents.                   Page 76                      1. Would you be able to check, if water is hard by using a detergent?                   Ans. The answer is both yes or no.                        In case the detergent is soap, then it is possible to check the hardness of water, as soap forms                        scum in hard water.                        In case the detergent is synthetic, then it is not possible to check the hardness of water as                        synthetic detergent produces lather in hard water.                      2. People use a variety of methods to wash clothes. Usually, after adding soap, they ‘beat’ the                        clothes on a stone, or beat it with a paddle, scrub with a brush or the mixture is agitated in                        a washing machine. Why is agitation necessary to get clean clothes?                            (Imp.)                   Ans. Soap lowers the surface tension of water. The long chain non-ionic hydrocarbon group in soap                        sinks in the oil and grease droplets and thus loosen them from the fibres of clothes along with                        dirt. However, this loosening is insufficient to take out the tiny droplets of oil or grease along                        with dirt. Thus, the clothes are agitated by various methods, so that oil or grease droplets along                        with dirt are squeezed out.

Explain the nature of the covalent bond using the bond formation in CH Cl.                                                                                          3                  Ans. Carbon has atomic number 6. An atom of carbon has 2 electrons in the K-shell and 4 electrons                        in the L shell. Hydrogen (Z = 1) has one electron in its K-shell while chlorine (Z = 17) has                        two electrons in the K-shell, 8 electrons in L shell and seven electrons in the M-shell. In order                        to achieve a noble gas configuration, carbon shares its 4 electrons in the L-shell with three                        hydrogen atoms and one chlorine atom. As a result all the atoms of the combining elements                                       AL BROTHERS PRAKASHAN                        achieve a noble gas configuration.

Why does micelle formation take place when soap is added to water? Will a micelle be formed                        in other solvents such as ethanol also.                                                               OR                        What are micelles? How does the formation of a micelle help to clean the clothes.                                                                                                [2011 (T-II)]                  Ans. A molecule of soap is made up of two parts:                    (i) an ionic part which is hydrophilic (water loving) and (ii) a hydrocarbon chain which is                        hydrophobic (water hating).                        When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic tail of soap will not be soluble in water                        and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in water and the                        hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water.                        Inside water, the soap molecules form clusters to keep the hydrocarbon part out of water. In                        a cluster, the hydrophobic tails are in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends are on the                        surface of the cluster. This formation is called a micelle.                        Yes, micelle formation will also take place in ethanol.                     9. Why are carbon and its compounds used as fuels for most applications?                  Ans. Carbon and its compounds can easily burn in air at a moderate rate producing large amount of                                 GOY                        heat energy. The products produced during combustion pollute the atmosphere marginally, but                        are far superior as compared to products produced by burning substances like sulphur. Further,                        they are available in nature in large amount at an affordable price.                   10.

A sample of water which contains Ca  or Mg  ions dissolved in it, is called hard water. Soap                                                                                        +                        is a sodium salt of long chain carboxylic acid and is represented by RNa  where ‘R’ stands for                        the long chain of fatty acids.                                        2+                                2+                        When Ca  or Mg  ions come in contact with soap molecules they form compounds R Mg  2+                                                                                                       2                        or R Ca 2+  which are insoluble in water and appear in the form of scum.                            2                    11. What change will you observe, if you test soap with litmus paper (red and blue)?                  Ans. In case of blue litmus paper, no change will take place.                        In case of red litmus paper, it changes to blue colour. It is because soap is basic in nature on                        account of the presence of some amount of free sodium hydroxide.                                                              10","12.

The process by which hydrogen atoms are added to unsaturated hydrocarbons in the presence                        of heated and finely divided nickel so as to form saturated hydrocarbons, is called hydrogenation.                        Industrially hydrogenation is used to convert unsaturated vegetable oils to saturated vegetable                        oils (commonly called vanaspati ghee) by passing hydrogen through them in the presence of                        finely divided nickel.                                                              →                                        H C = CH  + H   ⎯⎯⎯  CH CH                                                            Ni                                         2       2     2   573K     3   3                                                                        Ethane                   13.

Give a test that can be used to differentiate chemically between butter and cooking oil.                  Ans. Butter is chemically saturated fatty acid, whereas cooking oil is unsaturated fatty acid. They can                        be differentiated by adding them to bromine solution. The bromine solution will decolourise in                        case of cooking oil, but not in case of butter.                                GOY                   15. Explain the mechanism of the cleansing action of soaps.                                [2008]                  Ans. A molecule of soap is made up of two parts:                          (i) An ionic part which is hydrophilic, i.e., water soluble.                         (ii) A hydrocarbon chain which is hydrophobic, i.e., water repellent (oil soluble).                                                  long chain hydrocarbon  polar end                                                 (hydrophobic end)  (hydrophilic end)                         When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic tail protrudes out of water while the ionic                        end remains inside water.                        Inside water, the molecules form clusters with the hydrophobic tails in the interior of the cluster                        and the ionic ends on the surface of the cluster. This formation is called a micelle.                                                                11","Soap, in the form of micelle collects the oily dirt in the centre of the micelle. The micelles stay                        in solution as a colloid and do not precipitate due to ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt suspended                        in water is washed away during rinsing.

Why?                                                          [2011 (T-II)]                  Ans. An unsaturated hydrocarbon has high concentration of carbon, which does not get oxidised by                        the atmospheric oxygen. Thus, unburnt carbon appears in the form of soot and hence the flame                        is sooty.                      2.

[2008]                                                                2+                                                      2+                  Ans. Hard water contains dissolved Ca  and Mg  ions  which react with soap to form their                        respective insoluble salts, commonly called scum.                        The scum not only wastes soap but sticks to the clothes which are being cleaned. Therefore,                        soaps are ineffective in hard water.                   14.

Short Answer Questions - II                                              [3  Marks]                                                   Previous Years'  Questions                      1. Give reasons for the following :                        (a) Unsaturated hydrocarbons show addition reactions but not saturated hydrocarbons.                        (b) Carbon only forms covalent compounds.                               [2011 (T-II)]                  Ans.  (a) Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as ethene (C H ) and ethyne (C H ) have double or triple                                                                      4                                                                                     2                                                                                       2                                                                    2                            covalent bonds respectively. Hence they show addition reactions to form new single                            covalent bond while saturated hydrocarbons have only single covalent bonds so they do not                            show addition reaction.                        (b) Carbon has four valence electrons.  Thus, it is not in a position to donate/accept four                                GOY                            electrons so as to acquire a stable neon gas like structure. Thus, in order to enter into a                            chemical reaction, it shares its valence electrons with other elements. So it forms only                            covalent compounds.                      2. (a) Define the term functional group. Identify the functional group present in the following                           compounds :                            (i) CH  — CH  — CH  — OH                                          2                                  3                                                  2                            (ii)                          (b) What will you observe on adding a 5% alkaline potassium permanganate solution drop by                            drop to some warm ethanol taken in a test tube? Write the name of the compound formed                            during the above chemical reaction.                                 [2011 (T-II)]                                                               23","Ans.  (a) Functional group : The functional group in an organic compound is an atom or a group                            of atoms bonded together in such a unique fashion, that it is usually the site of chemical                            reactivity of an organic molecule.

What are detergents chemically? Why are they more effective than soaps in cleansing action?                                 GOY                        How can detergent molecules be altered to make them biodegradable?      [2011 (T-II)]                  Ans. Detergents are sodium salt of long chain benzene sulphonic acid or sodium salt of long chain                        alkyl hydrogen sulphate.                        Synthetic detergents are more effective than soaps because their calcium and magnesium salts                        are soluble in water and do not form scum.                        If a straight chain hydrocarbon is used in the detergent instead of a branched chain                        hydrocarbon, then the detergent becomes biodegradable.                     5.

Name the compounds ‘A’ and ‘B’ and write                        their structural formula.  What happens when ‘A’ and ‘B’ react in the presence of an acid                        catalyst? Write the chemical equation for the reaction.            [2010, 2011 (T-II)]                  Ans. Ethyl alcohol is an essential constituent of wine and beer.  Therefore,  A is ethyl alcohol.                        Oxidation of ethyl alcohol gives acetic acid. Vinegar contains acetic acid. Therefore, B is acetic                        acid.

Hydrogenation reaction                         Most of the vegetable oils are unsaturated fatty acids having double bond in the long carbon                        chain. When these vegetable oils are heated to 300° C in the presence of finely divided nickel                        and hydrogenm gas is passed through it, the double bond between the carbon atoms breaks to                        form single bonds and two hydrogen atoms are added at the reaction site.  Thus unsaturated                        vegetable oil changes to saturated vegetable oil, commonly called hydrogenated oil.

It has 6 electrons in L-shell, which is the outermost shell. In order to have a                  stable configuration like that of the nearest noble gas neon [2, 8], the oxygen atom must have eight                  electrons in the L-shell.                      Two oxygen atoms share two electron pairs mutually and attain stable configuration of neon.
